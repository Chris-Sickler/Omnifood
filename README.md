# UdemyCourse_HTML-CSS
Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3 by Jonas Schmedtmann

Full Udemy HTML/CSS course that covered the basics of both languages as well as Responsive web design. The course also covered some very basic Javascript and optimization techniques. This website project will be used in the future to practice HTML/CSS and future Javascript as I learn more.
