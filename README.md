# Omnifood
Course: Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3 by Jonas Schmedtmann

Omnifood is a fictional Food-service company used in the course to make the website relatable and practical. 
The website is a static site which is fully responsive(implemented with JQuery).


Part of a full Udemy HTML/CSS course that covered the basics of both languages as well as Responsive web design. The course also covered some very basic Javascript and optimization techniques. This website project will be used in the future to practice HTML/CSS and future Javascript as I learn more.
